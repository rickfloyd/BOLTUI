/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the Quantum CyberVision platform.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model, ensuring that users can only access and modify their own data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - All user data is nested under /users/{userId}.
 * - Each user has a dashboard configuration stored in /users/{userId}/dashboardConfig/{configId}.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only create, read, update, and delete their own user documents.
 * - Users can only create, read, update, and delete their own dashboard configurations.
 * - Data required for authorization is denormalized.  The `userId` field is present on the DashboardConfig documents to ensure that it matches the path.
